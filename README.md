# Convolutional_NN-TensorFlow
Convolutional Neural Network using tensorflow over CIFAR10 dataset

### CIFAR10 dataset Description
CIFAR10 is a dataset with a long history in computer vision and machine learning. Like MNIST, it
is a common benchmark that various methods are tested against. CIFAR10 is a set of 60,000 color images
of size 32Ã—32 pixels, each belonging to one of ten categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog,
frog, horse, ship, and truck.
